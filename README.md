#Sweet Feedback

This is an experimental project that I start in 2010 to learn a about CSS Animations.

Keep in mind that this project is stopped for years and because of that it is likely that your code is outdated.

**Use at your own risk.**

##Animation classses

`.su` = Slide up  
`.sr` = Slide right  
`.sd` = Slide down  
`.sl` = Slide left
